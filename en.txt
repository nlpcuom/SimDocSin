# This is a non-breaking prefix list for the English language.
# The file is used for sentence tokenization (text -> sentence splitting).
#
# The file was taken from Lingua::Sentence package:
#     http://search.cpan.org/~achimru/Lingua-Sentence-1.03/lib/Lingua/Sentence.pm
#

# Anything in this file, followed by a period (and an upper-case word), does NOT
# indicate an end-of-sentence marker.
# Special cases are included for prefixes that ONLY appear before 0-9 numbers.

# Any single upper case letter followed by a period is not a sentence ender
# (excluding I occasionally, but we leave it in).
# Usually upper case letters are initials in a name.
